05704104,"A method and machine are disclosed for using a cold dry abrasion step for separating segments of discarded carpet into pile material (usually nylon) and backing layers (usually polypropylene) for recycling. A preferred method of abrasion uses dry ice pellets (made of frozen carbon dioxide) which are ejected at high speed from a set of nozzles that shoot the pellets directly into an abrasion zone, as a segment of discarded carpet on a conveyor system is being stripped apart and disassembled. The dry ice pellets ""freeze"" the binder material (usually latex) by lowering it to a temperature that makes the binder brittle and easy to break apart. The pellets also serve as abrasive agents, in a manner comparable to sand-blasting; however, unlike sandblasting or liquid (steam or chemical) systems, the dry ice pellets evaporate (sublimate) directly into gas without going through a liquid phase, and without leaving any liquid or gritty residue. This eliminates the need for a drying operation, which saves time and energy and avoids a potential air pollution problem; it also renders the recyclable output material free of unwanted liquid residues, grit, or other materials that would decrease the value of the output material. This invention also discloses other processing methods which use cold dry abrasion, such as the use of freezing to render the latex binder brittle, coupled with the use of pellets made of a compatible material (such as nylon pellets, for carpets with nylone piles) as abrasive agents that can be mixed with the pile fibers that are recovered from a carpet without decreasing the value of the reclaimed pile material.","Method and machine for recycling discarded carpets"

05706364,"A method for producing, or training, a set of character templates uses as the source of training samples an image source of character images, called glyphs, that are not previously segmented or isolated for training. Also used is a labeled glyph position data structure that includes, for each glyph in the image source, a glyph image position in the image source associating an image location of the glyph with a character label paired with the glyph image position that indicates the character in the character set being trained. The labeled glyph position data is used to identify a collection of glyph sample image regions in the image source for each character in the character set; each glyph sample image region is large enough to contain a glyph and typically contains adjacent glyphs for other characters. The invention mathematically characterizes the template construction problem using unsegmented samples as an optimization problem that optimizes a function that represents the set of character templates being trained as an ideal image to be reconstructed to match the input image. The method produces all of the character templates contemporaneously by using a novel pixel scoring technique that implements an approximation of a maximum likelihood criterion subject to a constraint on the templates produced which holds that foreground pixels in adjacently positioned character images have substantially nonoverlapping foreground pixels. The character templates produced may be binary templates or arrays of pixel color probability values, and may also have substantially disjoint supports, such that adjacently imaged templates have substantially no overlapping foreground pixels.","Method of producing character templates using unsegmented samples"

05706192,"A method and apparatus for accessing anti-phase states in a nonlinear system by globally coupling an array of oscillators. For N number of oscillators in the system, there are (N-1)| anti-phase (AP) states in phase space. AP states exist where each waveform is staggered out-of-phase with every other wave form. The system is controlled between AP states by means of a linear parameter and a hyper-switch. In an out-of-phase (OP) state the orbit remains on a basin boundary between or among AP states. As the linear parameter is decreased to a specific value, the orbit leaves the basin boundary and enters a canonical invariant region (CIR) towards an attractor. Each CIR contains one AP state and one attractor. Once the orbit has reached an attractor within the CIR it shall remain there until the linear parameter is increased and system again becomes unstable. Accordingly, by controlling the bias current in the system, the orbit may remain on the basin boundary until such time as the bias current is altered and forces the orbit into an invariant region thereby attaining an AP state. Furthermore, if the orbit is in a CIR, the bias current may be adjusted so that the system becomes unstable and returns to the basin boundary. This method of accessing different AP states in a system of globally coupled oscillators uses a hyperswitch together with control and release techniques for switching between or among AP states by pulsing a linear parameter.","Antiphase switching in arrays of globally coupled oscillators"

05706085,"The method allows contact-less, precise and rapid measurement of the macroscopic shape of objects. The method is based on the Michelson-interferometer with the object mirror being replaced by the object to be measured. A low coherent light source is used. As either the reference mirror or the object is moved, an intensity modulation can be observed on the observation screen. The height information can be derived from determining the maximum depth of modulation in association with the movement. The determination of the depth of modulation has required full sampling of the modulation at a high sampling rate, or quasistatic movements. Therefore common methods are rather slow. The envelope of the modulation is directly extracted by modulating the light source synchronously to the modulation of the interference patterns and by using a solid-state imaging array which shows low pass characteristics in terms of time. The method allows to move the object or the reference mirror significantly faster than in conventional short coherent interferometers at a far lower sampling rate. If a light source cannot be modulated, the flux of light hitting the target or the sensitivity of the photodetector can be modulated instead.","Method for the non-contact rapid and accurate acquisition of the surface"

05706011,"A method that enables an aircraft to determine an optimal terrain following, terrain avoidance, or threat avoidance trajectory over terrain, thereby reducing its exposure and increasing its survivability. A grid of discrete terrain points corresponding to the terrain above which the aircraft is to fly is formed. Each point has a cost that is function of predetermined criteria. A cost is assigned to each of the points that is representative of the cost to get to the point based upon the predetermined criteria. A terminal point is selected that is a point that must be flown through at the end of the trajectory over the terrain, or in order to clear an obstacle in the flight path of the aircraft. A series of paths is computed through the terrain points to a selected terminal point, taking into account the aircraft's maneuvering capability and current attitude. A total cost at the terminal point is computed for each path, and the total cost for a particular path is the sum of costs at the terminal point plus the respective costs of all terrain points along the path. The path that has the least total cost to arrive at the selected terminal point is selected. The aircraft is then guided along a trajectory defined by the selected path. The present method not only generates trajectories lower than those generated by current procedures, but also identifies regions where natural terrain masking provides cover without requiring extremely low flight, thus reducing the stress on both aircraft and pilot.","Method for determining terrain following and terrain avoidance"

05706476,"Method and apparatus for more efficiently using the undefined logic state and mixed multiple state abstractions is described. The method involves dividing gates into two groups: those that require an 8-state table (either because their inputs are sensitive to 8-state values or their output produces an 8-state value), and those that require only 4-state values (their inputs are insensitive to 8-state values and the output produces only 4-state values). The key to obtaining the advantages of the invention is the choice of the 4-state values. Previously, the 4-state values have been 0, 1, X, and Z. By the invented method and apparatus, the 4-state values are defined instead to be 0S, 1S, XS, and U. In the Multi-value Logic 9-state model (MVL-9), U is defined to be the uninitialized state, and thus it is a state that all instances need to process on their inputs and to produce as an output. The Z (or high-impedance) state, on the other hand, is used only for certain specialized gates--typically tri-state buffers--and so the Z state is used only rarely in digital logic simulation. By shifting the definition of the 4-state abstraction from (0, 1, X, Z) to (0S, 1S, XS, U), almost all gates may be included in the 4-state category, thus allowing higher pin counts for the average digital logic simulation. The invented method and apparatus nevertheless permits the interconnection of 4-state values and 8-state values, while placing the significant overhead of the latter on the rare use thereof. Preferably, both 4-state and 8-state directives--instructions to a downstream gate that tells the gate how to attain a new state--are provided by the invented method and apparatus, and the gate receiving such plural directives effectively decides whether to use the 4-state abstraction or the more expensive 8-state abstraction.","Method and apparatus for use of the undefined logic state and mixed"

05706012,"The virtual interferometer is an improved method for generating multiple ultaneous transmit beams as effected by a phased array radar. The technique is particularly suited to a solid state active radar array having a transmit/receive (T/R) module that is located at each radiating element. Potential applications to radar systems include environments such as air traffic control in which wide area surveillance with high search rates may be required. With multiple simultaneous beam generation coupled with parallel receiver beamformers and processors, such a radar system could support large volume searches while preserving the narrow beam characteristics by using the full aperture for generation of each of the multiple beams. The multiple simultaneous beams are generated by applying a particular phase shift at each radiating element, with no requirement for amplitude modulation. To form the multiple simultaneous beams on transmit, the antenna is logically divided into a series of equal segments, with a quadratic or near-quadratic phase profile applied to each of the logical antenna segments. The curvature of the phase function determines the angular extent covered by the series of beams being generated. This phase function has the effect of focusing the radiation at a specific distance either in front of or behind the phased array antenna, depending on the sign of the curvature. Each of the logical antenna segments interferes coherently with the others, resulting in a constructive/destructive interference pattern in the far-field of the antenna.","Radar system method using virtual interferometry"

A single link is created to each file of the shared file system which a user wishes to access. A zymlink to the shared file system may be updated via a zupdate command. Rather than selectively updateing individual files, a user simply zupdate's whole trees of files. When it comes time to edit files, a user makes use of standard history managed file system commands to obtain a writable copy of a file. Use of one of these commands destroys a zymlink corresponding to the file, and substitutes a privately owned copy of the file on a user's disk. When the edited file is checked back into the history managed file system, a read-only copy of the file remains on a user's disk. When a user updates his or her file system, the read-only file copy may be replaced with a new zymlink. A user will normally view current versions of shared files. Rather than viewing current versions of shared files, a user may wish to maintain a static view of file versions by issuing a zreset command.

Writes or attempted writes to memory must be monitored by a processor in order to correctly resolve hits against the reservation state. In a two level cache system the second level cache filters bus operations and forwards to the processor any bus traffic that may involve data stored within the first level cache. This may be accomplished by enforcing an ""inclusion"" property wherein all data entries within the first level cache are required to be maintained within higher level caches. A problem arises when a block within a first level cache which has had a reservation pending is cast out and the second level cache no longer forwards bus traffic to the associated processor, despite the continued pendency of the reservation. This problem is avoided by setting a reservation flag each time a valid reservation is pending. Thereafter, any replacement of a data entry in a higher level cache results in the automatic deletion of the corresponding data entry within any included level of cache. The reservation flag is then reset in response to the occurrence of either a bus operation which affects the reservation address or the deletion of the cache data entry corresponding to the reservation address, permitting atomic memory references to be achieved without the necessity of distributing the reservation address.","Method and system for achieving atomic memory references in a multilevel"

05705335,"It has been discovered that the degree of hormonal activity of candidate ligands correlates better with degree of fit into DNA than with the strength of receptor binding, and that the receptors in the steroid/thyroid hormone/vitamin A and D family alter the physiochemical properties of DNA and in concert with other transcription factors facilitate insertion of the ligand into DNA. As a result, the magnitude of the response is a function of the structure of the ligand as it related to insertion and fit into the DNA and the specificity of the response is a function of the stereochemistry of the receptor through binding to both the ligand and to the DNA. Based on these discoveries, a method is described herein for identifying drugs having increased activity as compared with the natural ligand for receptors such as the estrogenic receptors.","Design of drugs involving receptor-ligand-DNA interactions"

05704692,"A sensor bracket for mounting an anti-lock braking sensor is welded to an axle with a welding method that causes a portion of a bracket preform to be consumed to form the weld joint. In one preferred embodiment, an outer end of a stem of the bracket is formed of a material that will be made molten by an arc between the bracket and the axle. A fluxing agent is preferably mounted on an extreme end of the stem to initially ignite and clean the area on the axle, and further insure that the other portions of the bracket will become molten. The method preferably includes supplying a current through the bracket preform and bringing the bracket preform towards the axle. The axle is grounded, and as the bracket preform is brought adjacent to the axle, an arc is formed between the two. Outer portions of the bracket preform thus become molten. A fixture for mounting the bracket preform continues to bring the bracket preform towards the axle for a predetermined period of time. After predetermined period of time, the current is disconnected. The bracket fixture continues to hold the bracket against the axle such that the weld joint may solidify. The inventive use of a welding method in which the bracket preform is consumed to secure the bracket preform to the axle provides for a secure connection. Moreover, this welding method allows the use of automated assembly techniques to secure the sensor bracket to the axle.","Method of welding a sensor bracket to an axle"

05704871,"A vehicle automatic transmission control system in which the clutch is controlled in a slipping state if a torque converter is locked up when the gear shift command is not output. When the engine speed fluctuates, the fluctuations pass through the transmission and wheels and act on the ground to produce a reaction which passes back through the wheels and vehicle body and acts on the passengers as surging.

The system comprises a frequency-modulated infrared transmitter, in operative combination with a switch for detecting brake system actuation, and a helmet module, including a frequency-modulated infrared receiver and decoder in operative combination with a stop light. Brake system initiation results in switch actuation which causes the transmitter to emit a beam of frequency-modulated infrared energy towards the helmet module. When the beam is received at the helmet module, it is captured using a lens in operative combination with a novel lightpipe which ensures reception over a 180 degree angle. The infrared energy is then transmitted through a solar filter which further discriminates between solar infrared energy and the infrared beam from the transmitter, before being received at an electro-optical circuit. This circuit decodes the frequency-modulated infrared energy and activates the auxiliary brake lamp.","Motorcycle safety helmet system"

05705436,"A physical implementation and method for achieving it are described for a load resistor and bus line subcircuit such as might be used in an SRAM cell. This was achieved by using two layers of polysilicon. The first polysilicon layer has low resistivity and serves to make effective contact to the drain regions of the FETs involved in the circuit. The second polysilicon layer has high resistivity and is used to form the load resistor as well as the collector bus line and resistor-drain connection. Formation of the latter two objects is achieved by providing a refractory metal underlay to the second polysilicon layer in the appropriate areas and then heating the structure so as to convert said refractory metal to its silicide. This process avoids the use of an ion implantation step during which some encroachment of the ions could occur, thereby retaining good control of the resistor dimensions.","Method for forming a poly load resistor"

05704691,"A cushion for forming the seat or back of an upholstered chair comprises a rigid unitary body member having a central, relatively flat portion between two marginal edge portions with upstanding ridges formed along each of the two edge portions. The ridges define a central depressed portion which is capable of receiving one or more layers of foam. A foam layer covers both the central layer or layers of foam and wraps over and around the edge ridges to pad the ridges. The ridges thereby serve to reduce precompression of the central foam layer or layers after the form is finished with a covering of upholstery. A chair having cushions with enhanced softness is thereby achieved. In another aspect of the invention, a form for a chair back includes a series of vertical spaced ribs in the lumbar region of the chair back.

05705739,"In most mammals studied, a histogram of the erythrocytes' density of a healthy individual normally has a Gaussian distribution. Gaussian or near-Gaussian distributions may be characterized by their mean, by their standard deviation, and their absence of skewness. A measurement of the erythrocyte density distribution (EDD) in mammalian whole blood which has been anticoagulated with heparin can yield information which is indicative of certain physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions that are characterized by various EDD abnormalities. These abnormalities may include abnormalities in the standard deviation of the EDD; the mean erythrocyte density; and any skewness of the EDD curve. The hematocrit or percent packed red cell volume, which is obtained at the same time as the EDD can also yield information. The EDD measurement is made by providing a sample of heparin anticoagulated whole mammalian blood to which is added a plurality of density markers having known individual specific gravities that are within the range of specific gravity values of mammalian erythrocytes. The blood sample-density marker mixture is centrifuged, and measurements are taken of the location of the density markers within the centrifuged erythrocyte cell pack. These measurements are analyzed to determine the standard deviation of the EDD in the sample; the mean erythrocyte density in the sample; the hematocrit value of the sample; and any skewness in the EDD curve in the sample. The resultant data is compared to empirical data obtained from patient populations with known normal and abnormal medical histories in order to determine whether there is any variation from norm of one or more of the parameters measured which are characteristic of abnormal medical conditions. Alternatively since an erythrocyte's hemoglobin concentration (HC) is the main determinant of an ethrocyte's density, HC measured on a cell counter that determines each erythrocyte's HC may be used as a surrogate for erythrocyte density. Suitable cell counters can also derive HCT from a blood sample.","Detecting specific medical conditions from erythrocyte density"

When the amount of fluorine in the exhaust is too high, the molten aluminum bath (44) is saturated with fluorine. The bath is then cooled to form an inert solid brick of AlF.sub.3. Therefore, fluorinated gases which are detrimental to the environment are cost-effectively removed from the output of a wafer fabrication facility.","Method and apparatus for using molten aluminum to abate PFC gases from a"
H0001706,"A new osteotomy guide for guiding saw blades when making an osteotomy cut in a bone is disclosed. Osteotomy is the surgical dividing of bone. The guide includes a base, a pair of prongs and a handle. The base includes a bore for passage of a K-wire or other guide pin. The prongs define a slot for passage of a surgical saw blade. The bore and slot are deeper than prior art osteotomy guides and thus stabilize the guide and the blade relative to the guide pin so that the plane of the saw blade remains parallel to the guide pin. This ensures that in multiple-cut osteotomy procedures all the planes of opposing cuts will exactly coincide when the cut ends are reattached. The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for all governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty.","Osteotomy guide"
H0001705,"A process for the preparation of 2-carboalkoxy-1-indanones of Formula I from 1-indanones of Formula II using a dialkyl carbonate and an alkali metal alkoxide is provided. This process is superior to the prior art in that it avoids pyrophoric reagents such as sodium hydride, and proceeds in high chemical yield and product quality. The invention provides a novel process to an important intermediate in the preparation of arthropodicidal carboxanilides of commercial interest. ##STR1## wherein: R.sup.1, R.sup.2 and M are defined in the specification.","Process for preparing 2-carboalkoxy-1-indanones"
H0001704,"Disclosed is a modified cellulose fiber having improved curl characteristics. Specifically, the present invention relates to oxidized or sulfonated cellulose fibers being highly curled, wherein such curl is highly stable. The oxidized or sulfonated curled cellulose fiber may be prepared by a process comprising treating the fibers in a high energy refiner effective to provide the desired curl properties to the fiber. The modified cellulose having improved curl characteristics may be used in disposable absorbent products.","Modified cellulose fiber having improved curl"
H0001702,"In the transmission electrical signals using an optical carrier the signal power carried by an optical carrier is proportional to the optical power. High optical power levels are desired for optical carriers that are modulated by weak electrical signals, however, significant unmodulated power is left in the original carrier after processing. To maximize the radio frequency (RF) signal power generated by a given (maximized) photodetector current (for a given input power), in this invention, the optical carrier power is reduced. This is accomplished by the addition of a narrowband optical filter, such as a Fabry-Perot filter, to reduce the average optical carrier power without reducing the modulation sidebands, which results in an increased modulation depth. Therefore, greater RF and microwave power is generated by a photodetector with the same photocurrent. With a laser source exhibiting a beam whose linewidth is narrow compared to the filter bandwidth, the filter is tuned, or frequency locked, to match the filtering resonance with the optical carrier wavelength. With the high finesse filter and narrow-linewidth laser beam, the frequency range of operation is extended from the filter half-bandwidth to the next resonance of the filter. Thus, broadband effective gain results without introducing additional noise.","Wideband fiber-optic signal processor"
